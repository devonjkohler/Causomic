**Causal inference methods for -omics research**

Causomic is a Python package for causal inference on -omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, phosphoproteomics, etc.). Its goal is to predict the effects of interventions (e.g., drug treatments, protein inhibitions) on biological systems by combining prior-knowledge interaction networks with deep probabilistic causal models.

## Overview

A fundamental challenge in biological experimentation is understanding how interventions (e.g., drug treatments, protein inhibitions) affect complex biological systems. Traditional machine learning approaches, particularly black box models, attempt to predict these effects without explicitly modeling the underlying causal relationships. This can be problematic when explainability is crucial (e.g., identifying disease-driving pathways) or when models incorrectly infer that downstream proteins causally influence upstream targets. Causomic addresses these limitations by:

1. **Integrating prior biological knowledge** from biological network databases (e.g., INDRA)
2. **Building causal graphs** that represent protein relationships and reconciling them with experimental data
3. **Training deep probabilistic models** with variational Bayesian inference (Pyro/PyTorch)
4. **Predicting intervention effects** on downstream proteins with uncertainty quantification

The package is particularly useful for:
- Drug discovery and target identification
- Understanding protein pathway dynamics
- Predicting off-target effects of interventions
- Analyzing perturbation experiments in proteomics

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- PyTorch 2.3+ (< 2.5)
- Pyro-PPL

### Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/Causomic.git
cd Causomic
pip install -e .
```

### Optional dependencies
- `dev` — testing and linting tools (`pytest`, `black`, `isort`):
  `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- **INDRA-CoGEx** — required only for the Neo4j backend of prior extraction
  (`extract_indra_prior(..., backend="neo4j")` and the
  `causomic.graph_construction.prior_extraction.neo4j_*` modules). It is not on
  PyPI; install it from source if you need those features:
  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/gyorilab/indra_cogex.git
  ```
  The rest of the package works without it.

## Getting Started

The end-to-end workflow follows three steps:

1. **Learn the causal graph** — build a prior-knowledge network (e.g. from INDRA)
   and reconcile it with your data into a causal DAG.
2. **Train the structural causal model** — fit the latent-variable model (`LVM`)
   to your protein-level data over that graph.
3. **Predict interventions** — query the trained model for the downstream
   effect of an intervention (e.g. inhibiting a target protein).

📓 **The complete, runnable walkthrough lives in the
[User Manual notebook](vignettes/user_manual.ipynb).** It covers both a
simulated ground-truth system and a real INDRA network (EGFR inhibition),
from graph construction through interventional inference. Start there.

### Getting a prior network from INDRA

Step 1 above needs an INDRA-derived edge set. `extract_indra_prior` produces one
from either of two backends, returning the same
`source`/`target`/`evidence_count`/`source_count` table each way, so the rest of
the pipeline is unaffected by which you pick.

- **Local INDRA snapshot (default, offline).** Load a pre-cached INDRA network —
  e.g. a `networkx.DiGraph` pickled from an INDRA CoGEx export — and pass it as
  `graph`:

  ```python
  import pickle
  from causomic.network import extract_indra_prior

  with open("indranet_dir_graph_fix_corr_weights.pkl", "rb") as f:
      indra_graph = pickle.load(f)

  prior_edges = extract_indra_prior(
      source=["EGFR"],
      target=["ERK"],
      measured_proteins=data.columns.tolist(),
      graph=indra_graph,
      n_mediators=2,
  )
  ```

  This requires no live database connection — only a local copy of the INDRA
  graph pickle — and is the pattern used throughout the lab's own projects.

  For finer control, the underlying steps are available separately:
  `prepare_graph` filters the raw graph, and `query_forward_paths`,
  `query_neighborhood_paths`, `query_drug_targets`, and `query_effect_nodes`
  run the path searches. Import them from
  `causomic.graph_construction.prior_extraction`.

- **Live Neo4j query.** Pass `backend="neo4j"` with an authenticated client to
  query a running INDRA CoGEx instance directly, which is useful when you need
  up-to-date statements rather than a static snapshot. It requires the optional
  [INDRA-CoGEx install](#optional-dependencies) and a reachable Neo4j database:

  ```python
  from indra_cogex.client import Neo4jClient

  prior_edges = extract_indra_prior(
      source=["EGFR"],
      target=["ERK"],
      measured_proteins=data.columns.tolist(),
      backend="neo4j",
      client=Neo4jClient(url=api_url, auth=("neo4j", password)),
  )
  ```

## Data Requirements

### Input Data Format
Causomic expects data in different formats depending on where in the pipeline
you start. The causal model and graph construction expect data in wide format
with genes as columns, samples as rows, and values being quantitative
experimental measurements.

### Preprocessing with MSstats (R)

If you are using MS-based proteomics data, we recommend running the data through
the MSstats pipeline via `dataProcess`. The resulting `ProteinLevelData` object
can be passed directly into Causomic. A Python-side `dataProcess` is available in
`causomic.data_analysis` for simulated and summarized data.

## Main Components

### 🕸️ **Graph Construction** (`causomic.graph_construction`)
Three subpackages, one per stage of building a causal graph.

**`prior_extraction`** — pull a candidate edge set out of INDRA, from a local
`networkx` graph (default) or a live Neo4j-CoGEx instance.
- `prepare_graph`, `add_evidence_info`, `filter_graph_by_evidence_count`
- `query_forward_paths`, `query_neighborhood_paths`, `query_drug_targets`,
  `query_effect_nodes`, `query_confounders`
- `resolve_curies`, `format_query_results`, `pull_downstream_network`

  `query_forward_paths` is the built-in control for maximum path length /
  mediator count between a source and target node — its `n_mediators`
  argument caps how many intermediate nodes a path may have, so you don't
  need to reimplement path-length pruning yourself.

**`posterior_estimation`** — learn which candidate edges the data supports.
- `SparseHillClimb` — hill-climb search restricted to prior edges
- `BICGaussIndraPriors`, `BICGaussNoPriors`, `AICGaussIndraPriors`,
  `AICGaussNoPriors` — scoring functions, with and without the prior term
- `run_bootstrap`, `consensus_dag`, `best_scoring_dag` — resample, then reduce
  many candidate DAGs to one
- `run_dagma` — continuous-optimization alternative to the hill climb
- `prepare_indra_priors`, `calculate_edge_probabilities` — evidence counts to
  edge probabilities
- `filter_to_causal_subgraph`, `search_path_diagnostic`

**`ci_repair`** — test the learned graph and repair what fails.
- `find_failed_tests`, `convert_to_y0_graph`
- `lookup_confounder_candidates`, `process_failed_test`

### 🎯 **Causal Modeling** (`causomic.causal_model`)
Probabilistic structural causal models for intervention prediction.
- `LVM` — latent-variable model (fit / intervention interface)
- `ProteomicPerturbationModel`, `StochasticEdgeProteomicModel` — underlying Pyro models

### 📈 **Data Analysis** (`causomic.data_analysis`)
Proteomics preprocessing and downstream analysis.
- `dataProcess`, `normalize_median`, `summarize_data`, `imputation`
- `gen_correlation_matrix`, `test_gene_sets`, `prep_msstats_data`
- `run_ora`, `fetch_pathway_library`, `select_diverse_pathways`, `export_to_cytoscape`

### 🧪 **Simulation** (`causomic.simulation`)
Synthetic graph and data generation for testing and method development.
- `mediator`, `backdoor`, `frontdoor`, `signaling_network` — example graphs
- `simulate_data`, `generate_coefficients`, `build_igf_network`
- `generate_structured_dag`, `generate_indra_data`, `generate_cyclic_graph`

### 🚀 **High-Level Entry Points**
- `causomic.network` — network estimation helpers (`estimate_posterior_dag`,
  `filter_to_causal_subgraph`, `repair_confounding`, `extract_indra_prior`, …)
- `causomic.workflows` — packaged pipelines (`run_causal_workflow`,
  `run_toxicity_detection_workflow`)

  `extract_indra_prior` defaults to `backend="nx"`, which reads a local INDRA
  graph pickle and needs no credentials. `backend="neo4j"` queries INDRA-CoGEx
  live and requires the optional [INDRA-CoGEx install](#optional-dependencies)
  (see [Getting a prior network from INDRA](#getting-a-prior-network-from-indra)).
