"""Utilities for working with NetworkX graphs produced by INDRA.

This module provides helpers to filter graphs by statement types and
evidence, compute simple path-based queries, and prepare graphs for
downstream analysis. Functions generally accept and return NetworkX
DiGraph objects and, where noted, may modify graphs in-place.

The file intentionally keeps behaviour stable while adding documentation
and small readability improvements.

    """Search for simple forward paths from any start node to any end node.

    This is the built-in control for how far a path is allowed to travel
    between a source and target node: ``n_mediators`` sets the maximum number
    of intermediate nodes allowed on a source -> target path (path length =
    ``n_mediators + 1`` edges). Use it instead of reimplementing path-length
    pruning on top of the raw graph.

    For each mediator depth from 0..n_mediators the function will collect
    paths with exactly that many intermediate nodes between the start and
    end nodes. This corresponds to path lengths of ``mediator_count + 1``
    edges, subject to the corresponding evidence and source count thresholds.

    When ``exclude_other_starts`` is True (the default), paths are not
    allowed to pass through any other start node: when searching from a
    given ``start`` to a given ``end``, any node in ``start_nodes`` other
    than ``start`` (and ``end`` itself, if it happens to be in
    ``start_nodes``) is excluded from intermediate traversal. This is the
    right behavior when ``start_nodes`` and ``end_nodes`` are genuinely
    distinct groups (e.g. drug targets vs. disease targets) and a path
    shouldn't be credited to routing through another root cause.

    Set ``exclude_other_starts=False`` for the closed-neighborhood case
    where ``start_nodes`` and ``end_nodes`` are the same list of nodes and
    you want all pairwise relations among them, including ones mediated by
    other members of that same list (see :func:`query_neighborhood_paths`).

    Args:
        graph: DiGraph annotated with evidence counts on edges.
        start_nodes: Iterable of starting node ids.
        end_nodes: Iterable of target node ids.
        n_mediators: Maximum number of intermediate nodes allowed on a
            source -> target path (path length = n_mediators + 1 edges).
        med_ev_filter: Per-depth evidence-count thresholds: a list of length
            ``n_mediators + 1`` where index ``i`` applies to paths with
            ``i`` mediators. If None, defaults to all ones.
        med_src_filter: Per-depth source-count thresholds: a list of length
            ``n_mediators + 1`` where index ``i`` applies to paths with
            ``i`` mediators. If None, defaults to all ones.
        exclude_other_starts: If True (default), other nodes in
            ``start_nodes`` are excluded from intermediate traversal for any
            given (start, end) pair. Set to False to allow other start nodes
            to serve as mediators.

    Thin wrapper around :func:`query_forward_paths` for the closed-set case:
